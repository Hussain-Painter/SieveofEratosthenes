Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is an efficient algorithm to find prime numbers upto n.
It's running time is O(n(log(log(n))))

The algorithm is as follows:
1)Initialize boolean arr[n] with True
2) Set arr[0] & arr[1] to False
3) from i = 2 to sqrt(n):
          if (arr[i] == True):
              from j = i * i to n:
                  arr[j] = False
                  j = j + i
              i ++
4)while arr[j] == True
            print(arr[j])
              j ++
